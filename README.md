# affine_mortality

The code in this repository allows to estimate, analyse and project a number of affine mortality models (see Ungolo, Sherris and Zhou (2021) and Huang, Sherris, Villegas and Ziveyi (2021)) by using the maximum likelihood with the univariate Kalman Filter. More information about the functionalities are available in the pdf guide.
